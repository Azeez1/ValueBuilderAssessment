    subtitle: "Your history of producing revenue and profit combined with the professionalism of your record keeping",
    description: "A financial acquirer sees buying a business as paying today for a stream of profits in the future, which is why companies are generally bought and sold using a multiple of earnings. But focusing on your multiple is a little bit like a hypertensive person focusing on his or her blood pressure report.

    description: "Acquirers typically pay the most for businesses with the potential to grow. In rare cases, an acquiring company may even buy a business that scores high on Growth Potential but low on other attributes, because the acquirer sees a way to leverage some of its own assets to help the business grow much more quickly than it could under its current owner.",

Imagine a playground teeter-totter that can move in only two directions: when one end goes down, the other must go up.
